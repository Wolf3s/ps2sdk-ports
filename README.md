## What is it?
This git repository contains various numbers of ports working with the current `ps2sdk`. It is not intended to be a releasable package.

Most of the ports contain specific changes to make them work for the `ps2sdk`, however, there are some ports included as a `git clone` that are being compiled using original source code, just adding the specific `PS2` flags (using `cmake`).

## Compilation & Installation

Easy for everyone, just type 
```
make
```
